			<h2>Embrace all the Potentials!</h2>
				<!--Definition of mulitpotentialite derived from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipotentiality -->
				<p><b>Multipotenitalite:</b> a person who has many different interests and creative persuits in life. Multipotenitalites have no "one true calling" and thrive on learning, exploring, and mastering new skills.</p>
				<p>Call me a hobbiest, generalist, or multipotentialite, but for as long as I can remember I have always dabbled in a wide range of activites. These "hobbies", which I like to think of more as "passions", inlcude outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing, hunting, snowshoeing, skiing (I could go on...), as well as natural sciences, travel, exercise, art, cooking, and gardening. If anything is certian, I am positive this list will only grow longer with time! I beleive it is ok to embrace the potentials and to refuse to choose just a handfull of hobbies, interests or passions.</p> 
				<p>So, if you're like me and your head is often in the clouds thinking about all YOUR passions and the potentials that come with them, take a listen to my favourite song <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8ccDb6n5Wg"> "Old Pine" </a> by Ben Howard <!--Inserting an in-line external link to youtube modified from: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp-->, which I find always helps bring me back to reality.</p>
